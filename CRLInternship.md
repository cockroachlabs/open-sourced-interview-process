## What to Expect During Your Engineering Internship

**Timeline**

To set your expectations for your internship, here is a timeline of feedback loops leading up to receiving a potential offer to return.

- 30 Day New Hire Survey
  - When: 30 days after your start date
  - Who: You
  - What: 30-day surveys are a great way for us to share whether your initial expectations of working at Cockroach Labs are being met. The intent is to learn more about what is going well and what could be going better. You will play an active role with how we can continue to make Cockroach a great place to work for Roachers. If you are interested in meeting with Chelsea to give more direct feedback about the program, please reach out to schedule time with her. Understanding how our employees work within our company allows us to focus on areas that are important to Roachers.
  
- Mid Internship Check-in
  - When: Halfway through your Internship
  - Who: You and your manager
  - What: Your mid-internship check-in is a way for your manager to give you feedback on your internship and performance thus far. The check-in also lets you know if there are any skills that you need to develop or work on to receive a return offer at the end of your internship.
  
- End of Internship Check-in
  - When: 2 weeks before your end of internship
  - Who: You and your manager
  - What: Prior to this meeting, People Ops meets with your manager to discuss your performance during your internship and prepare your offer, if applicable. During this meeting, your manager may extend an offer to you.
  
**Mentor / Roachmate**

Your Roachmate will be your Mentor during your internship at Cockroach Labs.  During your first week at Cockroach Labs, your Mentor will sit down with you to lay out your starter project. The explanation will include not just what your project entails, but also a crash course on the existing components in CockroachDB.  It’s tough to take all this information in at once. That’s okay! You should feel no shame in asking your Mentor to verbatim re-explain these details a day, a week, or a month later.

You will be meeting with your Mentor weekly for 1:1s throughout your internship. Use this time to share what is going well or where you are stuck. In the beginning, they will also be using this time to share the culture, attitude, and expectations. Always feel encouraged to reach out to them with any questions regarding the office environment and the project that you are working on.  They can also introduce you to other people in the company that you may be interested in working with.

**Manager**

The Manager of the team will also be accessible to your during your internship. This person will usually function as the Manager or the Tech Lead of the team. They will reach out to schedule monthly 1:1s with you to check in and see how your project is going.

**Learning and Development**

You are welcome to attend all and any Lunch and Learns, Reading Groups, Fireside Chats and workshops. During your last week, you will present the project that you have been working on for the duration of your internship.  This will be treated as a Lunch & Learn. Here are some examples of past internship presentations:

Yahor - Window Functions
Paul - Joins
Richard - Interleaved Tables
