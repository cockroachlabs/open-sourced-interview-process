## What to Expect During Your Engineering Internship


## Resources
  
**Mentor / Roachmate**

Your Roachmate will be your Mentor during your internship at Cockroach Labs.  During your first week at Cockroach Labs, your Mentor will sit down with you to lay out your starter project. The explanation will include not just what your project entails, but also a crash course on the existing components in CockroachDB.  It’s tough to take all this information in at once. That’s okay! You should feel no shame in asking your Mentor to verbatim re-explain these details a day, a week, or a month later.

You will be meeting with your Mentor weekly for 1:1s throughout your internship. Use this time to share what is going well or where you are stuck. In the beginning, they will also be using this time to share the culture, attitude, and expectations. Always feel encouraged to reach out to them with any questions regarding the office environment and the project that you are working on.  They can also introduce you to other people in the company that you may be interested in working with.

**Manager**

The Manager of the team will also be accessible to your during your internship. This person will usually function as the Manager or the Tech Lead of the team. They will reach out to schedule monthly 1:1s with you to check in and see how your project is going.

**Learning and Development**

You are welcome to attend all and any Lunch and Learns, Reading Groups, Fireside Chats and workshops. During your last week, you will present the project that you have been working on for the duration of your internship.  This will be treated as a Lunch & Learn.
